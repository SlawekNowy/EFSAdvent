PNPC (Panel Overwrite NPC)
Causes a tile to be changed to a different tile.

Variable 1: Trigger value
Should be "triggering actor"s trigger value + 4.
e.g. If a switch has value 120, this must be 124(may need to be hex XC, and switch X8)

Variable 2:
Somehow determines which layer the tile change occurs on.

Variable 3 & Variable 4:
Value of tile that appears.
This are actually a single 16-bit number.
So:
1
165
= 255 + 165.
