Top line of pixels is cut off?

undo doesn't work properly for 2x2 brush

Remove reliance on unused "sprite master sheet"

Controls should be disabled until a level is loaded, e.g. the layer checkboxes as they can cause a crash.

Implement "brushes" using SMP files, and other custom ones?

Support for .bti files and bti actors(BTIN, SIBT)

Display background image appropriate to layer(? This is changed via an actor?)

Add unsafe code with lockbits to draw actor sprites? Is it worth is even for large numbers of actors? Not really, only a 1 second~ delay, but if I'm bored one day...

make possible creation of new maps from scratch? Not worth doing unless I hack a way to add new maps to the game.

add support for different actor sprites depending on the variable, e.g. SWEV_0_0_0_40.png
